                              <p class="lead"> To collaborate with diverse communities to design, build, test, 
                                and implement wind powered technology utilizing both the cultural characteristics 
                                of our customers and the technical capabilities of community environments. Through 
                                our work, we aim to serve society by developing sustainable, safe and functional 
                                devices that act as educational tools to both the team and the end users.

                                 <p class="lead">BLUElab Woven Wind is an engineering design team focused 
                                    on wind energy and sustainability. In the past, the team has worked with 
                                    rural communities in Guatemala to design and build a small-scale wind turbine 
                                    to charge cellphone batteries.
                                </p> 
                                 <p class="lead"> In 2014, we transitioned towards creating wind 
                                    turbines to be used as educational tools. We began our venture
                                     by working with Allen Elementary School in Ann Arbor. We designed 
                                     and implemented a wind turbine with a 5th grade class to power a 
                                     small application, such as a cellphone, in their classroom. While 
                                     this project refined our technical experience working with wind 
                                     technology, we also worked closesly with the class teacher and 
                                     planned hands-on activites for the 5th graders to help them see a 
                                     real world demonstration of their science curriculum. 
                                 </p> 
                                  <p class="lead">In the future, we plan to continue creating wind 
                                    turbines for educational purposes. We will continue working locally
                                     in Ann Arbor, as well as internationally in Guatemala and El Salvador, 
                                     where we have collaborators that are planning similar activites and 
                                     technologies for their respective communities.

                             <h3 class="section-heading"> What is A2 STEAM? </h3>
                                 <p class="lead"> 
                                   A2 STEAM at Northside is a new K-8 school in the Ann Arbor school district. This 
                                   school represents a new and innovative way of teaching kids. They are focused on hands-on project 
                                   based learning and have a passion for developing an innovative way of thinking. To find out 
                                   more about A2 STEAM, check out their website: http://www.a2schools.org/a2steam.home/home

                    <h3 class="section-heading"> What Are We Doing? </h3> 
                         <p class="lead">We are working with our partner, Cindy Johengen, once again as well 
                             the other fifth grade classrooms at A2 STEAM to educate students about wind turbines. 
                             We have already had several educational workshops on the blades, anemometers, and wind 
                             turbines in general and will continue visiting the school throughout the year. While this 
                            is going on at the school we are working on designing and analyzing our plans for our new 
                            turbine
                         </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading"> What Is Our Goal? </h3> 
                         <p class="lead"> Our final goal of this year's project is to implement
                             a turbine that can be left up at A2 STEAM for extended periods of time without
                             Woven Wind supervision. We want this to happen so students and teachers can have 
                             access to it to learn at their own convenience.
